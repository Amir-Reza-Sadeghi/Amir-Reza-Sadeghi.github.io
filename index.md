# A brief description of my selected Dataset:
Among the available datasets and information banks, [San Francisco Government Open Data](https://datasf.org/opendata/) caught my attention. This site has been created to empower the use of data. The great thing about this site is that all the datasets are made available to the public for free. Datasets are also classified into different groups based on type and subject, and each person can easily find datasets related to their field of work. The interesting thing for me was that one of the categories was related to Transportation. So, I am excited to have access to many helpful datasets related to my major.

One of the datasets of this data bank was the [Map of Speed Limits in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Map-of-Speed-Limits/ttcm-fwt2). This dataset includes a Data visualization of the Speed Limits in different parts of San Francisco. In our researches, sometimes we need to know the Traffic limitations to have accurate predictions. Municipal Transportation Agency has published this dataset.

The application of the above dataset is in Transportation Decision Makings. It helps researchers to find the optimum predictive solutions in areas with a large number of accidents. 

In addition to the "San Francisco Government Open Data," I founded [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) very helpful. Many datasets in various fields have been collected on this site and made available to the public. The exciting thing for me is that this site, like the previous one, allows users and students working in the field of Data Science to work on Real data.

# Introduction of one free-data-science-book:
From the available books, I chose the book ["A Course in Machine Learning."](http://ciml.info/) This book was written by  [Hal Daum√© III](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/), a professor at the University of Maryland. Given that my major is Transportation Engineering, I work as a Research Assistant in projects that deal with huge amounts of traffic data. I will be involved in research projects on intelligent transportation systems and traffic safety. My research activities include exploring traffic data from multiple sources, including video cameras, roadway collision databases, and mobile applications to build models for improving traffic safety and mobility, and demonstrating how intelligent transportation systems technologies and big data analytics can be utilized to assess transportation safety and mobility at different locations of the roadway network. So, this book helps me learn fundamental concepts of Machine Learning and different Algorithms. To be more successful in carrying out my projects and thesis in this field, I have to get acquainted with Machine Learning Algorithms. The advantage of this book is that it presents the basic and important concepts related to Machine Learning from the first step. Many people who do not have a background in Machine Learning can use this book. This book has 19 chapters, and some of its most important chapters are Neural Networks, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Probabilistic Modeling, etc.
